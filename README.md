# Kick or Not

## Project Description

One of the biggest challenges of an auto dealership purchasing a used car at an auto auction is the risk of that the vehicle might have serious issues that prevent it from being sold to customers. **The auto community calls these unfortunate purchases "kicks"**.

Kicked cars often result when there are **tampered odometers, mechanical issues the dealer is not able to address, issues with getting the vehicle title from the seller, or some other unforeseen problem**. Kick cars can be very costly to dealers after transportation cost, throw-away repair work, and market losses in reselling the vehicle.

Modelers who can figure out which cars have a higher risk of being kick can provide real value to dealerships trying to provide the best inventory selection possible to their customers.

**The challenge of this competition is to predict if the car purchased at the Auction is a Kick (bad buy)**.
